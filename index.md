<!-- START OF WEBSITE SUMMARY -->
The Handley Research Group ([https://www.handley-lab.co.uk](https://www.handley-lab.co.uk)) is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of cosmological understanding through the development and application of cutting-edge artificial intelligence and Bayesian statistical inference methods. Our research spans a wide range of topics, from the very first stars and galaxies to the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and the fundamental laws of gravity. We are committed to developing open-source software and fostering a collaborative research environment.

Our core research themes include:

* **Simulation-Based Inference (SBI):** We are developing next-generation SBI methods for analyzing complex cosmological datasets like the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). This includes building realistic simulations of the Universe incorporating astrophysical effects and systematics, and training neural networks to efficiently perform parameter inference and model comparison (as outlined in our grant application [https://www.handley-lab.co.uk/future_research_directions](/future_research_directions.html)).

* **AI-driven Cosmological Parameter Estimation:**  We apply advanced AI techniques, including neural ratio estimation ([NRE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11457)), to constrain cosmological parameters from CMB ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00906](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00906)), BAO ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08165](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08165)), and supernovae ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02075](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02075)) data.  We are also exploring the use of AI to address the Hubble tension ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02075](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02075)).

* **21-cm Cosmology:** We are developing novel Bayesian data analysis techniques ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11457](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11457)) to probe the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization using the 21-cm signal. This includes developing robust foreground modelling techniques ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10448](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10448)), accounting for instrumental systematics ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04445](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04445)), and developing fast, accurate emulators for the 21-cm signal ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04336](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04336)). We are also investigating the impact of the primordial stellar initial mass function ([IMF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02099)) and cosmic rays ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07201](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07201)) on the 21-cm signal.

* **Primordial Cosmology:**  We study the physics of the very early Universe, including inflation ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00906](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00906)),  primordial non-Gaussianity ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03016](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03016)), and the implications of spatial curvature ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08524](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08524)).  We have developed innovative methods for reconstructing the primordial power spectrum ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08658](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08658)) and the inflationary potential.

* **Testing General Relativity:**  Our work extends to testing Einstein's theory of gravity on cosmological scales, utilizing data from various sources, including gravitational waves ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17663](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17663)).

Our group has a strong record of publications in high-impact journals, contributing significantly to the field of cosmology. We actively participate in international collaborations, including the GAMBIT collaboration, and are committed to open-source software development, making our tools and techniques accessible to the wider scientific community. Our future research, as detailed in our grant application ([https://www.handley-lab.co.uk/future_research_directions](/future_research_directions.html)), focuses on developing even more advanced SBI methods, including neural ratio estimation and automated model building, to tackle the challenges posed by next-generation cosmological datasets.  We are particularly excited about exploring extensions to General Relativity and deepening our involvement in interdisciplinary collaborations within the GAMBIT framework.  We are also interested in investigating the potential of AI models ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13263](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13263)) for enhancing scientific discovery.
