![DALL·E 3 prompt: "The Cambridge University skyline, but the sky is instead the multimessenger night sky; the Planck CMB anisotropies should form the far distant background, with supernovae explosions, gravitational waves and large scale structure visible in the middle ground, all visible over the dreaming spires of King's college, the Institute of Astronomy and the backs of the river Camb. A team of cosmology researchers should be silhouetted facing away from the viewer, standing together"](/assets/images/tmpbas7n88j.PNG)

The Handley Lab is at the forefront of a revolution in our understanding of the Universe. We develop and deploy cutting-edge artificial intelligence, driven by Bayesian inference, to analyze the vast and complex datasets generated by the world's most powerful telescopes, particle colliders, and gravitational wave detectors. By harnessing the incredible precision of these observations, along with state-of-the-art simulations created by our world-leading collaborators, we can extract the subtle whispers of dark matter, dark energy, and the fundamental laws governing the cosmos.  Our expertise lies in developing and implementing next-generation algorithms that can efficiently and accurately decode these cosmic messages, pushing the boundaries of traditional analysis methods and enabling us to explore the Universe’s deepest secrets.  We test the limits of our current understanding, exploring modifications to Einstein's theory of gravity and searching for the signatures of new physics. Join us on this journey of discovery as we use AI to illuminate the Universe's grand design.
