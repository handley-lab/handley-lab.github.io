![DALLÂ·E 3 prompt: "The Cambridge University skyline, but the sky is instead the multimessenger night sky; the Planck CMB anisotropies should form the far distant background, with supernovae explosions, gravitational waves and large scale structure visible in the middle ground, all visible over the dreaming spires of King's college, the Institute of Astronomy and the backs of the river Camb. A team of cosmology researchers should be silhouetted facing away from the viewer, standing together"](/assets/images/tmpbas7n88j.PNG)


We are a Cambridge research group at the Institute of Astronomy using cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) to advance our understanding of the Universe. We develop sophisticated algorithms, powered by Bayesian inference, to analyse data from a variety of sources, including telescopes, particle colliders, and gravitational wave detectors. 

Our research focuses on extracting information from complex datasets to address fundamental questions in cosmology and astrophysics.  We work with state-of-the-art simulations, created by our collaborators, to test and refine theoretical models, uncovering the secrets of dark matter, dark energy, and the fundamental laws of physics. 

Our team is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of astrophysical analysis, using AI to unlock new discoveries and shed light on the Universe's greatest mysteries.
