<!-- START OF WEBSITE SUMMARY -->
The Handley Research Group is dedicated to advancing our understanding of the Universe through the development and application of cutting-edge artificial intelligence and Bayesian statistical inference methods. Our research spans a wide range of cosmological topics, from the very first moments of the Universe to the nature of dark matter and dark energy, with a particular focus on analyzing complex datasets from next-generation surveys.

## Research Focus

Our core research revolves around developing innovative methodologies for analyzing large-scale cosmological datasets. We specialize in Simulation-Based Inference (SBI), a powerful technique that leverages our ability to simulate realistic universes to perform robust parameter inference and model comparison, even when likelihood functions are intractable ([LSBI framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03921)).  This focus allows us to tackle complex astrophysical and instrumental systematics that are challenging to model analytically ([Foreground map errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10448)).

A key aspect of our work is the development of next-generation SBI tools ([Gradient-guided Nested Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03911)), particularly those based on neural ratio estimation. These methods offer significant advantages in efficiency and scalability for high-dimensional inference problems ([NRE-based SBI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11457)).  We are also pioneering the application of these methods to the analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background ([CMB](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00906)) data, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations ([BAO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08165)) from surveys like DESI and 4MOST, and gravitational wave observations.

Our AI initiatives extend beyond standard density estimation to encompass a broader range of machine learning techniques, such as:

* **Emulator Development:** We develop fast and accurate emulators of complex astrophysical signals ([globalemu](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04336)) for efficient parameter exploration and model comparison ([Neural network emulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13263)).
* **Bayesian Neural Networks:** We explore the full posterior distribution of Bayesian neural networks for improved generalization and interpretability ([BNN marginalisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11151)).
* **Automated Model Building:**  We are developing novel techniques to automate the process of building and testing theoretical cosmological models using a combination of symbolic computation and machine learning ([Automated model building](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03581)).

Additionally, we are active in the development and application of advanced sampling methods like nested sampling ([Nested sampling review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15570)), including dynamic nested sampling ([Dynamic nested sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03459)) and its acceleration through techniques like posterior repartitioning ([Accelerated nested sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17663)).

## Highlight Achievements

Our group has a strong publication record in high-impact journals and on the arXiv preprint server. Some key highlights include:

* Development of novel AI-driven methods for analyzing the 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn ([21-cm analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11531)).
* Contributing to the Planck Collaboration's analysis of CMB data ([Planck 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06205)).
* Development of the PolyChord nested sampling software ([PolyChord](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00171)), which is now widely used in cosmological analyses.
* Contributions to the GAMBIT global fitting framework ([GAMBIT CosmoBit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03286)).
* Applying SBI to constrain dark matter models ([Dirac Dark Matter EFTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02056)).

## Future Directions

We are committed to pushing the boundaries of cosmological analysis through our ongoing and future projects, including:

* Applying SBI to test extensions of General Relativity ([Modified Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03581)).
* Developing AI-driven tools for efficient and robust calibration of cosmological experiments ([Calibration for astrophysical experimentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00099)).
* Exploring the use of transformers and large language models for automating the process of cosmological model building.
* Applying our expertise to the analysis of data from next-generation surveys like Euclid, the Vera Rubin Observatory, and the Square Kilometre Array.  This will allow us to probe the nature of dark energy with increased precision ([Dynamical Dark Energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08658)), search for parity violation in the large-scale structure ([Parity Violation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16030)), and explore a variety of other fundamental questions.

  summary: 'We present an updated reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state,

    $w(a)$, using the newly released DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)

    data in combination with Pantheon+ and DES5Y Type Ia supernovae measurements,

    respectively. Building on our previous analysis in arXiv:2503.08658, which

    employed a nonparametric flexknot reconstruction approach, we examine whether

    the evidence for dynamical dark energy persists with the improved precision of

    the DESI DR2 dataset. We find that while the overall qualitative structure of

    $w(a)$ remains consistent with our earlier findings, the statistical support

    for dynamical dark energy is reduced when considering DESI DR2 data alone,

    particularly for more complex flexknot models with higher numbers of knots.

    However, the evidence for simpler dynamical models, such as $w$CDM and CPL

    (which correspond to $n=1$ and $n=2$ knots respectively), increases relative to

    $\Lambda$CDM with DESI DR2 alone, consistent with previous DESI analyses. When

    combined with Pantheon+ data, the conclusions remain broadly consistent with

    our earlier work, but the inclusion of DES5Y supernovae data leads to an

    increase of preference for flexknot models with more than two knots, placing

    $w$CDM and CPL on par with $\Lambda$CDM.'

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    \section{Introduction}

    The standard model of cosmology, $\Lambda$CDM, has been remarkably successful in explaining a wide range of cosmological observations.

    Recent work has reinforced the importance of understanding the nature of dark energy through increasingly precise cosmological measurements.
    In our previous study \citep{2025arXiv250308658O}, we employed a nonparametric flexknot reconstruction \cite[originally termed `nodal reconstruction'][]{pkvazquez,devazquez} of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w(a)$, to explore the possibility of dynamical dark energy.
    Using a flexible linear-spline approach with free-moving nodes, our analysis of DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) combined with either Pantheon+ or DES5Y Type Ia supernovae data unexpectedly revealed a W-shaped structure in $w(a)$.
    This structure, which deviates from the conventional constant-$w$ ($\Lambda$CDM) picture, raised questions about whether standard parameterisations such as $w$CDM or CPL might be too restrictive to capture the true dynamical behavior of dark energy.
    This is acknowledged in the DESI DR2 release \citep{desi2025, desi2i, desi2ii}, which includes an entire paper dedicated to an extended dark energy analysis \citep{desi2de}.

    In this update, we investigate how the conclusions of \cite{2025arXiv250308658O} change in light of DESI DR2.

    \section{Data}\label{sec:data}

    \begin{figure}

        \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{plots/desi3_DR1_comparison_20_wa.pdf}
        \caption{
            Flexknot reconstruction of $w(a)$ using DESI DR2 BAO data using flexknots, compared to DR1.
            Upper left panel: the reconstructed $w(a)$.
            The dashed line is the mean of the posterior, and the shaded region is the $1\sigma$ contour.
            The overall shape is similar to DR1, but the transition around $a=0.6-0.7$ is less pronounced.
            Upper right panel: the evidence for each number of knots $n$, relative to $\Lambda$CDM.
            The biggest change is the new data admits a constant $w$ model ($n=1$) as a viable model.
            Evidence for models with more than four knots is reduced compared to DR1.
            Lower left panel: posterior distributions of $\Omega_\mathrm m$ and $H_0r_\mathrm d$.
            Lower right panel: the same reconstruction as the upper left panel, but transformed to $w(z)$.
        }\label{fig:desidr12}
    \end{figure}

    \begin{figure}
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{plots/desi3_20_distances.pdf}
        \end{center}
        \caption{
            BAO distances reconstructed from DESI BAO data.
            The left column is DESI DR1, the right column is DESI DR2.
            The best-fit $\Lambda$CDM has been subtracted from each set of distances, and the $w(a)$ posteriors are repeated in the bottom two panels.
            $1\sigma$ contours are also shown.
            It can been seen how the smaller error bars in DR2 have produced a narrower $1\sigma$ contour for the reconstructions.
        }\label{fig:distances}
    \end{figure}

    We combine DESI DR2 BAO data with Pantheon+ \citep{pantheonplus} and DES5Y supernovae \citep{des5y}, respectively.
    DESI DR2 cosmological distances are used as they appear in Table~IV of \cite{desi2ii}.
    DESI DR1, Pantheon+, and DES5Y data 
    are used in precisely the same manner as in \cite{2025arXiv250308658O}.

    The DESI DR2 BAO improves constraints on cosmic expansion with a larger dataset of galaxies and quasars than DR1.
    In addition to the tightening of the error bars compared to the previous release, the Quasar Sample (QSO) now has sufficient signal-to-noise ratio that separate measurements of $D_\mathrm M(z)$ and $D_\mathrm H(z)$ are reported in DR2, whereas in DR1 only a volume-averaged $D_\mathrm V(z)$ value was reported \cite{desi2ii, desiiii}.

    \section{Methods}

    With these improved DESI DR2 measurements now available, we recap the flexknot-based methodology that enables us to explore dynamical dark energy in a nonparametric way.
    In this approach, $w(a)$ is modelled using a flexible linear spline between free-moving nodes.
    This technique is well-established in multiple fields within cosmology: it has been used to reconstruct history of the dark energy equation of state from CMB data \citep{sonke, devazquez}, the primordial power spectrum \citep{pkhandley, pkvazquez, pkknottedsky, pkcore, pkplanck13, pkplanck15}, the cosmic reionisation history \citep{flexknotreionization, heimersheimfrb}, galaxy cluster profiles \citep{flexknotclusters}, and the $\SI{21}{\centi\metre}$ signal \citep{heimersheim21cm, shen}.
    Unlike dark energy reconstructions such as Gaussian processes \cite{modelagnosticgp, quintom, 2025arXiv250304273J, 2025arXiv250315943G} or cubic splines \citep{2025arXiv250313198B}, flexknots can reconstruct arbitrarily sharp features, and have extremely weak functional correlation structure. Flexknots also have the advantage that the $w$CDM and CPL models correspond to the special cases of $n=1$ and $n=2$ knots, respectively.

    Posterior samples and evidences were obtained using the nested sampling algorithm \texttt{PolyChord} \citep{skilling2004, polychord1, polychord2}.
    A branch of \texttt{fgivenx} was used to produce the functional posterior plots \citep{fgivenx}, and \texttt{anesthetic} was used to process the nested sampling chains \citep{anesthetic}.

    As in \cite{2025arXiv250308658O}, $H_0$ and $M_B$ are marginalised over, and the prior on $M_B$ is taken to be uniform and sufficiently wide to contain the entire posterior.
    In the DESI analyses \cite{desi2ii, desivi}, it is enforced that $w_0+w_a<0$ to ensure that there is a period of matter domination at high redshifts.
    In this work, we take $w_i < 0$ to achieve the same effect.

    Table~\ref{tab:priors} lists the cosmological priors used in this work, the same as \cite{2025arXiv250308658O}, which themselves were chosen to remain consistent with those used in \cite{desicrossingstatistics}.

    \section{Results}\label{sec:results}
    
    Figure~\ref{fig:desidr12} shows  reconstructions of $w(a)$ from DESI alone, and compares DR1 and DR2.
    Figure~\ref{fig:distances} shows the corresponding BAO distances reconstructed from DESI BAO data, compared to the best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model.
    The most significant change is not in the shape of the $w(a)$ posterior, but the evidences for each number of knots $n$ in the reconstruction.
    The greatest contrast is in the single knot case ($w$CDM), for which there is now a very slight preference relative to $\Lambda$CDM in DR2, whereas $w$CDM was reasonably disfavoured in DR1.
    As the number of knots increases, the evidences tend to a lower value for DR2 than for DR1.
    This means that DR2 is less supportive than DR1 of the flexknot model.

    The most significant change to the reconstructed $w(a)$ is the transition around $a=0.6-0.7$, which is the region containing the two LRG points whose affect was investigated in detail in \cite{2025arXiv250308658O}.
    This has moved to slightly higher redshifts, and is tighter than in DR1.
    The DR2 reconstructions have a more pronounced transition at slightly higher redshifts between phantom and quintessence than DR1, which continues to be the case when supernovae are included.

    Looking specifically, however, at $n=2$ (i.e. the CPL parameterisation), we note that the evidence slightly increases relative to $\Lambda$CDM with DR2 compared to DR1. This matches the conclusion of \cite{desi2ii} that DR2 more strongly supports CPL dark energy over $\Lambda$CDM than DR1, although the overall evidence for both flexknots, and CPL, is marginal.

    Figure~\ref{fig:desidr2ia} shows a comparison  of results from the DESI DR1/DR2 BAO data when combined with Pantheon+ and DES5Y supernovae, respectively.
    The evidences for $w$CDM in DR2 are very similar to those with DR1 and, as when using DESI alone, the evidences tend to a lower value for DR2 than for DR1 as the number of knots $n$ increases.
    Most notably, there is now a preference for models with large numbers of knots with DESI DR2 + DES5Y, which was the only combination in \cite{2025arXiv250308658O} which had any evidence in favour of dynamical dark energy, and the CPL model is still favoured.
    
    When combining data it is prudent to check that the datasets are consistent with each other. Here we follow \cite{2025arXiv250308658O} in using the tension analysis developed and deployed in \cite{lemos, hergt, balancingact} via the $\log R$ statistic. 
    In Figure~\ref{fig:tension} we show the tension quantifications between DESI and supernovae datasets. For DESI vs Pantheon+, there has been a slight increase in tension between DR1 and DR2, but they remain consistent. For DESI vs DES5Y the tension has decreased between DR1 and DR2, and is now consistent for all but the $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM cases. In this sense, dynamical dark energy models can be viewed as resolving a discrepancy between DESI and DES5Y data, in addition to providing a better fit to the data.

    For reference, we show the non-overlayed reconstructions of $w(a)$ for the remaining combinations of datasets in Figure~\ref{fig:separated}. DESI alone can be seen in the lower panels of Figure~\ref{fig:distances}.

    \section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

    We revisited the dynamical dark energy reconstructions presented in \cite{2025arXiv250308658O} using the newly-released DESI DR2 BAO data in combination with Pantheon+ and DES5Y supernovae measurements, respectively.
    Our analysis employed a flexknot methodology to reconstruct the evolution of the dark energy equation of state $w(a)$.
    Overall, we find that while the qualitative shape of the reconstructed $w(a)$ remains consistent with our previous work, there is a marked change in the statistical evidence for dynamical dark energy.

    The DESI DR2 data alone lead to a reduction in the evidence as compared with DR1 for flexknot models with larger numbers of knots.
    However, the evidence for the $w$CDM and CPL models, which correspond to $n=1$ and $n=2$ knots respectively, have increased compared to $\Lambda$CDM with DESI alone, which aligns with the conclusions of \cite{desi2ii}.
    When the DESI DR2 BAO data are combined with Pantheon+ supernovae, the conclusions are similar to those in our original work.
    
    However, with DES5Y supernovae, there is now increased evidence for models with a larger number of knots, with evidence for CPL, which remains the preferred model, also increasing, and with $w$CDM remaining on-par with $\Lambda$CDM. In addition to providing a better fit, dynamical dark energy models serve to resolve a discrepancy between DESI and DES5Y data.
