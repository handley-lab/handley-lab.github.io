<!-- START OF WEBSITE SUMMARY -->
The Handley Research Group is dedicated to advancing our understanding of the Universe through the development and application of cutting-edge artificial intelligence and Bayesian statistical inference methods. Our research spans a wide range of cosmological topics, from the very first moments of the Universe to the nature of dark matter and dark energy, with a particular focus on analyzing complex datasets from next-generation surveys.

## Research Focus

Our core research revolves around developing innovative methodologies for analyzing large-scale cosmological datasets. We specialize in Simulation-Based Inference (SBI), a powerful technique that leverages our ability to simulate realistic universes to perform robust parameter inference and model comparison, even when likelihood functions are intractable ([LSBI framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03921)).  This focus allows us to tackle complex astrophysical and instrumental systematics that are challenging to model analytically ([Foreground map errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10448)).

A key aspect of our work is the development of next-generation SBI tools ([Gradient-guided Nested Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03911)), particularly those based on neural ratio estimation. These methods offer significant advantages in efficiency and scalability for high-dimensional inference problems ([NRE-based SBI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11457)).  We are also pioneering the application of these methods to the analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background ([CMB](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00906)) data, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations ([BAO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08165)) from surveys like DESI and 4MOST, and gravitational wave observations.

Our AI initiatives extend beyond standard density estimation to encompass a broader range of machine learning techniques, such as:

* **Emulator Development:** We develop fast and accurate emulators of complex astrophysical signals ([globalemu](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04336)) for efficient parameter exploration and model comparison ([Neural network emulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13263)).
* **Bayesian Neural Networks:** We explore the full posterior distribution of Bayesian neural networks for improved generalization and interpretability ([BNN marginalisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11151)).
* **Automated Model Building:**  We are developing novel techniques to automate the process of building and testing theoretical cosmological models using a combination of symbolic computation and machine learning ([Automated model building](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03581)).

Additionally, we are active in the development and application of advanced sampling methods like nested sampling ([Nested sampling review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15570)), including dynamic nested sampling ([Dynamic nested sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03459)) and its acceleration through techniques like posterior repartitioning ([Accelerated nested sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17663)).

## Highlight Achievements

Our group has a strong publication record in high-impact journals and on the arXiv preprint server. Some key highlights include:

* Development of novel AI-driven methods for analyzing the 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn ([21-cm analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11531)).
* Contributing to the Planck Collaboration's analysis of CMB data ([Planck 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06205)).
* Development of the PolyChord nested sampling software ([PolyChord](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00171)), which is now widely used in cosmological analyses.
* Contributions to the GAMBIT global fitting framework ([GAMBIT CosmoBit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03286)).
* Applying SBI to constrain dark matter models ([Dirac Dark Matter EFTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02056)).

## Future Directions

We are committed to pushing the boundaries of cosmological analysis through our ongoing and future projects, including:

* Applying SBI to test extensions of General Relativity ([Modified Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03581)).
* Developing AI-driven tools for efficient and robust calibration of cosmological experiments ([Calibration for astrophysical experimentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00099)).
* Exploring the use of transformers and large language models for automating the process of cosmological model building.
* Applying our expertise to the analysis of data from next-generation surveys like Euclid, the Vera Rubin Observatory, and the Square Kilometre Array.  This will allow us to probe the nature of dark energy with increased precision ([Dynamical Dark Energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08658)), search for parity violation in the large-scale structure ([Parity Violation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16030)), and explore a variety of other fundamental questions.

\section{Introduction}
The concordance $\Lambda$CDM model and the Standard Model successfully explain a range of observed and theoretical phenomena in cosmology~\cite{2020A&A...641A...6P} and particle physics~\cite{1995iqft.book.....P}. However, several issues remain unresolved: For cosmology, there are the horizon~\cite{1972grun.book.....D} and flatness~\cite{1983Natur.305..673C} problems, as well as the composition and nature of dark matter and energy. For the standard model of particle physics, there is the cosmological constant problem~\cite{1989RvMP...61....1W}, Weyl anomaly~\cite{1994CQGra..11.1387D} and the strong $CP$ problem~\cite{1976PhRvL..37....8T}. Attempts to address these challenges often involve introducing new degrees of freedom, such as an era of inflation~\cite{1981PhRvD..23..347G}, a wide variety of dark matter particles~\cite{2019Univ....5..213P}, axions~\cite{1977PhRvL..38.1440P}, or modifying General Relativity~\cite{2012PhR...513....1C}. Despite these efforts, no single model can resolve all these issues simultaneously, and such modifications compromise the apparent simplicity of our universe as suggested by recent observations~\cite{2020A&A...641A...6P, 2024ApJ...966..157F}.

To address these challenges, \citet{2018PhRvL.121y1301B, 2022AnPhy.43868767B} propose a novel cosmological model known as the $CPT$-symmetric Universe. Rather than introducing new degrees of freedom, they posit that the universe is $CPT$-symmetric at the Big Bang singularity. Given this initial condition, the aforementioned issues could be solved without adding extra complexity~\cite{2021arXiv211006258B,2022arXiv220810396B,2024PhLB..84938442B,2023arXiv230200344T}. For example, the $CPT$-symmetric universe exhibits a periodic global structure, which allows for the calculation of its gravitational entropy~\cite{1977PhRvD..15.2752G}. As noted by \citet{2024PhLB..84938443T}, maximizing this entropy resolves the flatness, homogeneity, and isotropy problems without requiring inflation.

In this letter, we further investigate the impact of this periodic global structure on cosmological perturbations. Previous work by \citet{2022PhRvD.105h3514L} has explored this concept within the context of flat universes. Their findings suggest that the periodic conditions impose constraints on perturbations within the universe, which have observable effects on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectrum~\cite{2022PhRvD.105h3515B,2022PhRvD.105l3508P}.

Building on this work, we extend the analysis of \citet{2022PhRvD.105h3514L} to include curved universes. Our findings indicate that the constraints imposed by the future conformal boundary conflict with the spatial boundary conditions in a closed universe. To reconcile this conflict, only specific values of curvature are permissible, which are consistent with the observations from \texttt{Planck 2018}~\cite{2020A&A...641A...6P}, adding to the recent conversation in the literature surrounding closed universes~\cite{2020NatAs...4..196D, 2021PhRvD.103d1301H, 2022MNRAS.517.3087G, 2020MNRAS.496L..91E}.


\section{Background and perturbations} 
We build on the derivation presented in \citet{2022PhRvD.105h3514L} and extend it to a curved universe. The perturbed FLRW metric can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    ds^2 = a^2 \left[-(1 + 2\Phi)d\eta^2 + (1 - 2\Phi)\left(\frac{1}{1-\kappa r^2}dr^2+r^2d\Omega^2\right) \right],
\end{equation}
where \(\Phi\) is the perturbation in the Newtonian gauge, and $\kappa$ controls the spatial curvature of the universe.

We analyse the evolution of the background in conformal time \(\eta\) instead of physical time to render explicit the periodic behaviour of the universe. Following Lasenby~\cite{2022PhRvD.105h3514L}, only three components are considered: dark energy $\lambda$, radiation $r$, and spatial curvature $\kappa$, omitting matter. The zero-order Friedmann equations are: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:friedmann_eq}
    \dot{a}^2 = \tfrac{1}{3}\lambda a^4 - \kappa a^2  + \tfrac{1}{3} r, \qquad 
    \ddot{a} = \tfrac{2}{3}\lambda a^3 - \kappa a,
\end{equation}
where \(\hbar = c = 8\pi G = 1\) and dots denote \(d/d\eta\).

The solution to \cref{eq:friedmann_eq} can be expressed as a Jacobi elliptic function~\cite{2021arXiv210906204B}, which exhibits periodic global structure in conformal time. The universe begins at the Big Bang \(a = 0\), evolves to the end of the universe at \(a=\infty\) at a finite conformal time \(\eta_{\infty}\) termed the future conformal boundary (FCB), and then returns from the future boundary back to a future Big Bang, starting the cycle over again. However, this cyclic behaviour does not by default hold for perturbations. To maintain the behaviour, the perturbations should be symmetric not just at the Bang, but also at the FCB. The symmetry constrains the allowed modes of perturbations (see \cref{fig:a_perturbations-eta}).
\begin{figure*}[!ht]\centering
     \includegraphics{a_perturbations-eta.pdf}
     \caption{Evolution of the scale factor \(a\), its reciprocal \(s\equiv 1/a\), and the first five allowed perturbations which are (anti)-symmetric about the future conformal boundary. The perturbations have been normalised to have constant oscillatory amplitude across cosmic time for clarity.}
     \label{fig:a_perturbations-eta}
\end{figure*}

To analyse the perturbations, we write the first-order Einstein equation as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:perturbation_eq}
    \ddot{\Phi} + 4aH\dot{\Phi} + \tfrac{1}{3}(k^2 + 4a^2\lambda-12\kappa)\Phi = 0.
\end{equation}
where \(k\) is the comoving wave vector of the perturbation. Switching the independent variable from conformal time $\eta$ to scale factor $a$, one finds
\begin{equation}\label{eq:perturbation_a}
    (\lambda a^2 - 3\kappa + \frac{r}{a^2} )\Phi'' + (6\lambda a - \frac{15\kappa}{a} + \frac{4r}{a^3})\Phi' + (4\lambda+\frac{k^2-12\kappa}{a^2})\Phi = 0,
\end{equation}
where a prime denotes \(d/da\).

One degree of freedom between \(r\) and \(\lambda\) can be removed from \cref{eq:friedmann_eq,eq:perturbation_a} by fixing the scaling of \(a\). Following~\cite{2022PhRvD.105h3514L}, \(r = \lambda\) is chosen, equivalent to demanding \(a=1\) when the energy density of matter radiation and dark energy are equal, after which \cref{eq:perturbation_a} becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Phi_ODE}
    a(a^4 - 2a^2 \tilde\kappa + 1) \Phi'' + (6a^4- 10a^2 \tilde\kappa + 4 ) \Phi' + a(4a^2 + \tilde{k}^2-8\tilde\kappa) \Phi = 0, \nonumber
\end{equation}
\vspace{-2.5em}
\[ \text{where} \qquad
    \tilde{k} \equiv k/\sqrt{\lambda}, \qquad \tilde \kappa \equiv \frac{3}{2\lambda}\kappa\]
are the dimensionless wave vector and curvature respectively. This equation reduces to eq.~(23) in~\citet{2022PhRvD.105h3514L} when \( \tilde\kappa = 0 \).
Note that if we replace \(\Phi(a)\) with \(\varphi(a) \equiv a^2 \Phi(a)\), the equation remains invariant under the transformation \({a\leftrightarrow1/a}\). This symmetry is important in the next section when considering perturbations passing through the FCB as \(a\rightarrow \infty\).

This equation can be solved analytically, yielding two solutions. The solution can be expressed in terms of Heun functions:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}\label{eq:Heun}
    \Phi(a) &= \text{HeunG} \left( -1+2\tilde\kappa \tilde a_+^2,\frac{\tilde k^2-8\tilde\kappa}{-4 \tilde a_-^2},\frac{1}{2},2, \frac{5}{2},\frac{1}{2},a^2\tilde a_+^2\right)\\
    &\tilde a_{\pm}=\sqrt{\tilde\kappa\pm\sqrt{\tilde\kappa^2-1}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where \(\tilde a_{\pm}\) are the extremum values of the scale factor, corresponding to \(\dot{a}=0\) in \cref{eq:friedmann_eq}. Since the perturbation is frozen at the beginning and starts to oscillate after entering the horizon \(k = aH\), a specific linear combination of these solutions is selected to ensure that \(\Phi(a =0) = 1\) and \(\Phi'(a = 0) = 0\).


\section{Constraints from the future conformal boundary}\label{sec:constrain_FCB}
Next, we investigate the behaviour of perturbations near the FCB.  For universes with curvature \( \tilde{\kappa} \equiv \frac{3}{2\lambda}\kappa > 1 \), the scale factor \(a\) reaches a maximum before they collapse in a ``big crunch'', which are not physically relevant, since we observe an accelerating Universe today. This implies that the Universe cannot possess excessive curvature, establishing an upper limit of \(\tilde{\kappa} < 1\). In this case, the scale factor \(a\) approaches infinity at the FCB.
Consequently, we should consider the reciprocal scale factor \( s \equiv 1/a \). Because of the symmetry in \cref{eq:Phi_ODE}, the solution can be expressed as \(\Phi(s)= s^4 \Phi(a(s)) \). As a result, the solution would continue oscillating through the FCB until the future Big Bang. \citet{2022PhRvD.105h3514L} found that most perturbations diverge before reaching the future Big Bang. Only those solutions that are finite and symmetric or antisymmetric at the FCB remain non-singular (see \cref{fig:a_perturbations-eta}). This symmetry requirement means that only a discrete spectrum of wavevectors are allowed.

To calculate the discrete spectrum of wave vectors, we re-write the perturbation solution into an integral form \cref{eq:integration_sol}, where the sine component captures the solution's oscillatory nature:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:integration_sol}
\begin{aligned}
    \Phi(a) &= \frac{3\sqrt{a^4 + (\tilde{k}^2 -2\tilde\kappa)a^2 + 1}}{a^3\tilde{k}\sqrt{(\tilde{k}^2 -2\tilde\kappa)^2 - 4}} \sin\theta(\tilde k,\tilde\kappa,a),\\
    \theta = \int_0^a &\frac{\tilde{k} a'^2 \sqrt{(\tilde{k}^2 -2\tilde\kappa)^2 - 4}}{\sqrt{1 + a'^4 - 2\tilde\kappa a'^2} \left( a'^4 + (\tilde{k}^2 -2\tilde\kappa)a'^2 + 1 \right)} da',
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The integration in \(\theta(a)\) can be expressed as an incomplete elliptic integral of the third kind \(\Pi\):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:psi_elliptic}
\begin{aligned}
    \theta(a) = \tilde{k} \tilde a_- \times \Bigg[ &\Pi\left( \frac{a}{\tilde a_-}, -\frac{1}{2}\tilde a_-^2 \tilde K_{-}^2, \tilde a_-^2 \right) \\
    - &\Pi\left( \frac{a}{\tilde a_-}, -\frac{1}{2}\tilde a_-^2 \tilde K_{+}^2, \tilde a_-^2 \right) \Bigg],\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\vspace{-1.5em}
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
    &\Pi(z,\nu,k)=\int_0^z \frac{1}{(1-\nu t^2)\sqrt{1-t^2}\sqrt{1-k^2t^2}} dt,\\
    &\tilde K_{\pm}=\sqrt{(\tilde{k}^2 -2\tilde\kappa) \pm \sqrt{(\tilde{k}^2 -2\tilde\kappa)^2 - 4}}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
For the flat case (\(\tilde\kappa=0\)), the solution \cref{eq:integration_sol,eq:psi_elliptic} reduces to eq.~(26-28) in~\citet{2022PhRvD.105h3514L}.

If we require the solution to be (anti)symmetric at the FCB, the cycles of oscillation should be complete at the boundary. This implies that the angle \(\theta\) in the sine function should equal \( n\frac{\pi}{2} \) at \( a \rightarrow \infty \). 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:theta}
    \theta(\tilde{k}, \tilde\kappa, a \rightarrow \infty) \overset{!}{=} \frac{n\pi}{2}.
\end{equation}
The corresponding \(\tilde{k}\) are the allowed values of discrete wave vectors. The function \(\theta(\tilde k,a\rightarrow\infty)\) with different \(\tilde\kappa\) is illustrated in \cref{fig:theta_diffK}. While increasing the curvature value \(\tilde\kappa\), \(\theta\) becomes steeper, and the corresponding discrete wave vectors \(\tilde{k}\) have smaller spacing. 

\begin{figure}
     \includegraphics{theta_discretek.pdf}
     \caption{Phase of perturbations \(\theta(\tilde{k},a\rightarrow \infty)\) with different curvature \(\tilde\kappa\). Larger \(\tilde\kappa\) results in a steeper curve. The value of \(\theta\) should be \(\frac{\pi}{2}n, n\in\mathbb{N}\), where the corresponding \(\tilde k\) are the allowed wave vectors forming a discrete spectrum.}
     \label{fig:theta_diffK}
\end{figure}



\section{Implications for spatial curvature \(\Omega_K\)} 
These observations have significant implications for closed universes, where the compactness of spacial slices necessitates integer wave vectors (Sec.~2.4 in~\cite{2017CCoPh..22..852T}). This requirement is generally in conflict with the discrete spectrum of wave vectors arising from FCB considerations, prompting the question of whether this conflict can be resolved by matching the two discrete sets.

In \cref{fig:theta_diffK} \(\theta(\tilde{k})\) approaches a straight line for high-\(k\) modes due to perturbations oscillating as \(\sim \cos(\tilde{k}\eta/\sqrt{3})\).
This implies that the allowed wave vectors are equally spaced for high-\(k\) modes. By adjusting \(\tilde{\kappa}\), we can align the allowed wavevectors to be integers. Note that the unit of \(\tilde{k}\) differs from that of the integer wave vectors \(k_{\text{int}}\). The transformation between them can be expressed as: \(\tilde{k}\equiv  \sqrt{\frac{2\tilde{\kappa}}{3}} \sqrt{k_{\text{int}}(k_{\text{int}}+2) }  \approx \sqrt{\frac{2\tilde{\kappa}}{3}} k_{\text{int}}\) in high-\(k\) modes. Consequently, the actual gradient is given by:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\theta}{dk_{\text{int}}}(\tilde{\kappa},\tilde{k}\gg 1,a\rightarrow \infty) \approx \sqrt{\frac{2\tilde{\kappa}}{3}}\frac{\eta_{\infty}(\tilde{\kappa})}{\sqrt{3}} \overset{!}{=} N^{\pm 1}\frac{\pi}{2},
\end{equation}
where to match the integer wave vectors, the gradient should be \(N\frac{\pi}{2}\) or \(\frac{1}{N}\frac{\pi}{2}\) (where \(N\in\mathbb{N}\)), corresponding to either sparser discrete \(\theta\) or sparser \(k_{\text{int}}\) (see \cref{fig:theta_kint}). Since the gradient depends on \(\tilde{\kappa}\), this constrains the allowed curvature values. Some allowed \(\tilde{\kappa}\) values are shown in \cref{fig:Slope_kc}. The gradient increases with \(\tilde{\kappa}\) and approaches infinity as \(\tilde{\kappa}\) approaches unity, the maximum allowed curvature value. Beyond this value, the universe would collapse, resulting in a crunch.

\begin{figure}
     \includegraphics{theta-kint_loglog.pdf}
     \caption{Phase of perturbations $\theta$, in log-log plot. In the high-\(k\) mode, the gradient of \(\theta\) approximates a straight line, indicating that the discrete wave vectors are equally spaced. In a closed universe, these wave vectors must be integers, constraining the gradient to be \(N\frac{\pi}{2}\) or \(\frac{1}{N}\frac{\pi}{2}\) (where \(N\in\mathbb{N}\))..
     }
     \label{fig:theta_kint}
\end{figure} 

\begin{figure}
     \includegraphics{slope_kappa.pdf}
     \caption{The gradient of the phase of perturbations \(\theta\), as a function of \(\tilde\kappa\). The gradient constraint determines the preferred curvature values.}
     \label{fig:Slope_kc}
\end{figure} 

The predicted values of \(\tilde{\kappa}\) are then transformed to the current curvature density \(\Omega_K=-2\tilde{\kappa}\sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda\Omega_r}\) and compared with the \texttt{Planck 2018} data (\cref{fig:Planck_kappa}). The \(\tilde{\kappa}\), for unit gradient, corresponds to \(\Omega_K\sim -0.009\). The maximum curvature, \(\tilde{\kappa}=1\), corresponds to \(\Omega_K\sim -0.014\). Although this is closer to flat than the observational value of \(-0.044^{+0.018}_{-0.015}\)~\cite{2021PhRvD.103d1301H,2020NatAs...4..196D,2020A&A...641A...6P}, incorporating matter into our model would likely yield more precise predictions. Despite its simplicity, our model recovers curvature values consistent with observational data. 

\begin{figure}
     \includegraphics{Planck_kappa.pdf}
     \caption{Comparison of predicted curvature values with \texttt{Planck 2018} data (\texttt{base\_omegak\_plikHM\_TTTEEE\_lowl\_lowE} from~\cite{2020A&A...641A...6P}). Predicted curvature values from \cref{fig:Slope_kc} are shown.}
     \label{fig:Planck_kappa}
\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion} 
In this letter, we extended the work of \citet{2022PhRvD.105h3514L} and \citet{2021arXiv210906204B} by solving the first-order perturbation equation to derive analytic solutions. These solutions remain physical if they exhibit symmetry or antisymmetry at the FCB. This temporal boundary condition imposes a discrete spectrum on the wave vectors, which conflicts with the integer wave vectors derived from the spatial compactness of closed universes. Since both sets of discrete \(k\) values exhibit equal spacing in the high \(k\) regime, we can reconcile them by constraining the spatial curvature to specific values.. 

To refine the predictions of this allowed curvature spectrum further, we plan to solve the perturbations numerically in a more detailed universe model that includes matter and radiation anisotropy. The resulting solutions will be used to generate the CMB power spectra, which will then be compared with observational data, following the methodologies of~\cite{2022PhRvD.105h3515B} and~\cite{2022PhRvD.105l3508P}.
