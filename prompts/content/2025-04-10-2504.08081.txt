<!-- START OF WEBSITE SUMMARY -->
The Handley Research Group stands at the forefront of cosmological exploration, pioneering novel approaches that fuse fundamental physics with the transformative power of artificial intelligence. We are a dynamic team of researchers, including PhD students, postdoctoral fellows, and project students, based at the University of Cambridge. Our mission is to unravel the mysteries of the Universe, from its earliest moments to its present-day structure and ultimate fate. We tackle fundamental questions in cosmology and astrophysics, with a particular focus on leveraging advanced Bayesian statistical methods and AI to push the frontiers of scientific discovery. Our research spans a wide array of topics, including the [primordial Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08524), [inflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06211), the nature of [dark energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08658) and [dark matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17548), [21-cm cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07409), the [Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06209), and [gravitational wave astrophysics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17663).

### Our Research Approach: Innovation at the Intersection of Physics and AI

At The Handley Research Group, we develop and apply cutting-edge computational techniques to analyze complex astronomical datasets. Our work is characterized by a deep commitment to principled [Bayesian inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15570) and the innovative application of [artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10230).

**Key Research Themes:**
*   **Cosmology:** We investigate the early Universe, including [quantum initial conditions for inflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07042) and the generation of [primordial power spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07547). We explore the enigmatic nature of [dark energy, using methods like non-parametric reconstructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08658), and search for new insights into [dark matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17548). A significant portion of our efforts is dedicated to [21-cm cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04336), aiming to detect faint signals from the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization.
*   **Gravitational Wave Astrophysics:** We develop methods for [analyzing gravitational wave signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17663), extracting information about extreme astrophysical events and fundamental physics.
*   **Bayesian Methods & AI for Physical Sciences:** A core component of our research is the development of novel statistical and AI-driven methodologies. This includes advancing [nested sampling techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00171) (e.g., [PolyChord](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00171), [dynamic nested sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03459), and [accelerated nested sampling with $\beta$-flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17663)), creating powerful [simulation-based inference (SBI) frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10230), and employing [machine learning for tasks such as radiometer calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16791), [cosmological emulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13263), and [mitigating radio frequency interference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15448). We also explore the potential of [foundation models for scientific discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00096).

**Technical Contributions:**
Our group has a strong track record of developing widely-used scientific software. Notable examples include:
*   [**PolyChord**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00171): A next-generation nested sampling algorithm for Bayesian computation.
*   [**anesthetic**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04768): A Python package for processing and visualizing nested sampling runs.
*   [**GLOBALEMU**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04336): An emulator for the sky-averaged 21-cm signal.
*   [**maxsmooth**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14970): A tool for rapid maximally smooth function fitting.
*   [**margarine**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12841): For marginal Bayesian statistics using normalizing flows and KDEs.
*   [**fgivenx**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01711): A package for functional posterior plotting.
*   [**nestcheck**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06406): Diagnostic tests for nested sampling calculations.

### Impact and Discoveries
Our research has led to significant advancements in cosmological data analysis and yielded new insights into the Universe. Key achievements include:
*   Pioneering the development and application of advanced Bayesian inference tools, such as [PolyChord](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00171), which has become a cornerstone for cosmological parameter estimation and model comparison globally.
*   Making significant contributions to the analysis of major cosmological datasets, including the [Planck mission](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06209), providing some of the tightest constraints on cosmological parameters and models of [inflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06211).
*   Developing novel AI-driven approaches for astrophysical challenges, such as using [machine learning for radiometer calibration in 21-cm experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16791) and [simulation-based inference for extracting cosmological information from galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10230).
*   Probing the nature of dark energy through innovative [non-parametric reconstructions of its equation of state](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08658) from combined datasets.
*   Advancing our understanding of the early Universe through detailed studies of [21-cm signals from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03298), including the development of sophisticated foreground modelling techniques and emulators like [GLOBALEMU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04336).
*   Developing new statistical methods for quantifying tensions between cosmological datasets ([Quantifying tensions in cosmological parameters: Interpreting the DES evidence ratio](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04029)) and for robust Bayesian model selection ([Bayesian model selection without evidences: application to the dark energy equation-of-state](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.09024)).
*   Exploring fundamental physics questions such as potential [parity violation in the Large-Scale Structure using machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16030).

### Charting the Future: AI-Powered Cosmological Discovery
The Handley Research Group is poised to lead a new era of cosmological analysis, driven by the explosive growth in data from next-generation observatories and transformative advances in artificial intelligence. Our future ambitions are centred on harnessing these capabilities to address the most pressing questions in fundamental physics.

**Strategic Research Pillars:**
*   **Next-Generation Simulation-Based Inference (SBI):** We are developing advanced SBI frameworks to move beyond traditional likelihood-based analyses. This involves creating sophisticated codes for simulating [Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00906) and [Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00270) datasets from surveys like DESI and 4MOST, incorporating realistic astrophysical effects and systematic uncertainties. Our AI initiatives in this area focus on developing and implementing cutting-edge SBI algorithms, particularly [neural ratio estimation (NRE) methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15478), to enable robust and scalable inference from these complex simulations.
*   **Probing Fundamental Physics:** Our enhanced analytical toolkit will be deployed to test the standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM) with unprecedented precision and to explore [extensions to Einstein's General Relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03581). We aim to constrain a wide range of theoretical models, from modified gravity to the nature of [dark matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02056) and [dark energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08165). This includes leveraging data from upcoming [gravitational wave observatories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10210) like LISA, alongside CMB and large-scale structure surveys from facilities such as Euclid and JWST.
*   **Synergies with Particle Physics:** We will continue to strengthen the connection between cosmology and particle physics by expanding the [GAMBIT framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03286) to interface with our new SBI tools. This will facilitate joint analyses of cosmological and particle physics data, providing a holistic approach to understanding the Universe's fundamental constituents.
*   **AI-Driven Theoretical Exploration:** We are pioneering the use of AI, including [large language models and symbolic computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00096), to automate and accelerate the process of theoretical model building and testing. This innovative approach will allow us to explore a broader landscape of physical theories and derive new constraints from diverse astrophysical datasets, such as those from GAIA.

Our overarching goal is to remain at the forefront of scientific discovery by integrating the latest AI advancements into every stage of our research, from theoretical modeling to data analysis and interpretation. We are excited by the prospect of using these powerful new tools to unlock the secrets of the cosmos.

\section{Summary}\label{summary}

\href{https://github.com/samleeney/JAX-bandflux}{JAX-bandflux} is a JAX
\citep{jax2018github} implementation of critical supernova modelling
functionality for cosmological analysis. The codebase implements key
components of the established library SNCosmo \citep{barbary2016sncosmo}
in a differentiable framework, offering efficient parallelisation and
gradient-based optimisation capabilities through GPU acceleration. The
package facilitates differentiable computation of supernova light curve
measurements, supporting the inference of SALT \citep{kenworthy2021salt3,
pierel2022salt3} parameters necessary for cosmological analysis.

\section{Statement of need}\label{statement-of-need}

Accurate estimation of supernova flux is essential in cosmological
studies. These measurements are fundamental to the calibration of
standard candles and subsequent distance determinations, which are used
to answer cosmological questions. For example, the rate of expansion of
the universe. Current packages such as SNCosmo \citep{barbary2016sncosmo}
are widely used for analysing supernova data. However, traditional
implementations are not designed to run on GPUs and they lack
differentiability. A differentiable approach enables efficient gradient
propagation during parameter optimisation and supports large-scale
parallel computations on modern hardware such as GPUs. This JAX
implementation addresses these requirements by providing differentiable,
parallelisable routines for SALT parameter extraction.

\section{Implementation}\label{implementation}

The package is structured into several modules and example scripts that
demonstrate various aspects of the supernova modelling workflow. Two
primary example scripts, \texttt{fmin\_bfgs.py} and \texttt{ns.py},
illustrate optimisation via L-BFGS-B and nested sampling respectively.
These scripts utilise core routines from the JAX modules, following a
structure similar to SNCosmo while enabling differentiability and GPU
acceleration. The central computation is contained in the file
\texttt{salt3.py}, which implements the SALT3 model.

The SALT model is of the form: \[
F(p, \lambda) = x_0 \left[ M_0(p, \lambda) + x_1 M_1(p, \lambda) + \ldots \right] \times \exp \left[ c \times CL(\lambda) \right]
\] where free parameters are: \(x_0\), \(x_1\), \(t_0\), and \(c\).
Model surface parameters are: \(M_0(p, \lambda)\) and
\(M_1(p, \lambda)\) are functions that describe the underlying flux
surfaces, and \(p\) is a function of redshift and \(t-2\).

The computation of the bandflux is achieved by integrating the model
flux across the applied bandpass filters. Combining multiple bands, the
bandflux is defined as: \[
\text{bandflux} = \int_{\lambda_\text{min}}^{\lambda_\text{max}} F(\lambda) \cdot T(\lambda) \cdot \frac{\lambda}{hc} \, d\lambda
\] Here, \(T(\lambda)\) is the transmission function specific to the
bandpass filter used; \(h\) and \(c\) are the Planck constant and the
speed of light respectively.

Within \texttt{salt3.py}, the implementation computes the rest-frame
model flux by combining the base spectral surface \(M_0(p, \lambda)\)
with the stretch-modulated variation \(M_1(p, \lambda)\), each scaled by
their respective SALT parameters. These operations utilise JAX's
vectorised array manipulations, which are JIT-compiled for efficient,
parallel execution on GPUs. The resulting flux is computed in a fully
differentiable manner. The computed flux is then multiplied by the
instrument's transmission function \(T(\lambda)\) and by the wavelength
factor \(\lambda/(hc)\), followed by trapezoidal integration along the
wavelength dimension using JAX's numerical integration capabilities.
These operations are also JIT-compiled and can be parallelised across
multiple data instances via \texttt{vmap}.

The package includes comprehensive bandpass filter handling through the
\texttt{bandpasses.py} module, which provides a \texttt{Bandpass} class
to represent filter transmission functions. A set of commonly used
astronomical filters is pre-integrated into the system, whilst
additional custom bandpasses can be registered as needed through
functions such as \texttt{register\_bandpass} and
\texttt{load\_bandpass\_from\_file}. The system also facilitates the
creation of bandpass objects from the Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO)
filter service. For data handling, the \texttt{data.py} module offers
utilities for loading and processing supernova observations from various
formats, including functions to handle redshift data and prepare it for
model fitting. The package currently supports both SALT3 and SALT3-NIR
models through dedicated interpolation routines found in
\texttt{salt3.py}.

This architecture allows gradient propagation through the entire
analysis pipeline, enabling techniques that benefit from JAX's
differentiable, parallelisable programming paradigm. The implementation
maintains functional parity with SNCosmo whilst providing an enhanced
computational efficiency and scalability for contemporary cosmological
analyses.
