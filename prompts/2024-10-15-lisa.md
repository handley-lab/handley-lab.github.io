Dear all,

 

 We are delighted to announce a KICC special seminar by Kavli visitor, Riccardo Buscicchio (University of Milano-Bicocca) on Tuesday 15h Oct at 14:00 pm in the Hoyle Lecture Theatre, Institute of Astronomy.

  

  Beyond Gauss? A more accurate model for LISA astrophysical noise source

   

   Abstract: In this talk, I explore two assumptions ubiquitous in LISA data analysis: Gaussianity and stationarity of astrophysical noise sources (i.e. arising from source confusion). I will provide an overview on detection and parameter estimations techniques for both properties. I will review the most recent findings on the Galactic population of double white dwarfs and the extragalactic one of extreme mass-ratio inspirals. Employing a suite of advanced statistical techniques, we aim to enhance our understanding of the noise properties and improve the overall data modeling process, a core element of any global fit.

    

    We very much hope that you will be able to join us. 

     

     Best regards,

     Steve

# Beyond Gauss? A more accurate model for LISA astrophysical noise source

## Abstract: 

In this talk, I explore two assumptions ubiquitous in LISA data analysis: Gaussianity and stationarity of astrophysical noise sources (i.e. arising from source confusion). I will provide an overview on detection and parameter estimations techniques for both properties. I will review the most recent findings on the Galactic population of double white dwarfs and the extragalactic one of extreme mass-ratio inspirals. Employing a suite of advanced statistical techniques, we aim to enhance our understanding of the noise properties and improve the overall data modeling process, a core element of any global fit.

  - based on [2410.08263](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08263)
    - A test for LISA foreground Gaussianity and stationarity. I. Galactic white-dwarf binaries
  - based on [2410.08862](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08862)
    - A test for LISA foreground Gaussianity and stationarity. II. Extreme mass-ratio inspirals
- Published yesterday on arXiv:
  - umbrella of statistical noise modelling
- [2402.07571](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07571) 
  - Figure 2.2 
  - Focus on Galactic Binarios
  - EMRIs
  - Confusion noise (arising from the above)
    - expect so many that we will not bea ble to tell them apart
- galactic binaries 
  - very monochromatic
  - degenerate
- EMRIs
  - good for tests of GR
  - modelling of confusion noise might have effects on all the sources
- The fit:
  - writing the score
  - SMBH: 100s (can tell apart, very bright, isolated in time, specific pitch)
  - EMRIs: 10s-1000s multipee frequencies at the same time, regulated by a mass ratio, evolving harmonic pattern)
  - bulk 10000s (overlapping)
- The fit:
  - why 'global':
    - every one of those white dwarf binaries can be described by 7 parameters
    - $10^5$ parameters describing the full fit
    - $10^4$ resolvable sources
    - high dimensionality, want to break the problem into multiple pieces
- no definitive answer whether we should work entirely in frequency or time domain
- computationally infeasible to do a straight chain on a $10^5$ dimensional space
- Blocked Gibbs:
  - Discussion is active on this
  - A viable approach
  - Identify the morphology of different signals
  - fit for all the SMBH that are in the data
  - *Q: why is block gibbs better than a full MCMC?*

    - Littenberg & Cornish

    - Katz et al 
  - [2403.15318v3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15318)
    - Strub et al 
  - All trying to block/iterate the procedure 
- Rest of the talk _assumes_  that we have found the global fit (this is a big if)
- what is then missing in this big picture?
  - Noise model
    - detection theory:
      - distinguish between two models, one with signal $\mu+n$, one without signal $n$
    - Usually assume Gaussianity
    - Also assume stationary
- Detection statistics:
  - Neyman-Pearson way:
    - model the data under both hypotheses
    - fix the probability of false alarm $P_{FA}$
    - maximise the probability of detection $P_D$ at fixed $P_{FA}$
    - isolate the dependence on data in "detection statistics"
    - obtain a threshold as a function of $P_{FA}$
    - Bonus: thanks to likelihood principle $\mathcal{L}(d|H_1) = p(d|H_1)$
      - assuming a single hypothesis 
  - Likelihoods:
    - LVK
      - individual events: a model for the noise 
    - ET
      - multiple event: a model ofr the noise 
    - PTA
      - stochastic background: a model for two noises (or more)
    - LISA
  - Can't try with one, two and three sources (too many)
    - ideally have $N$ for both sources and background.
- Mane LISA plot has an assumption that the noise is gaussian 
- Galactic binaries
  - $10^4$ needles in 10^6 hay stacks 
  - coupling of detector to distribution of sources
  - tying together the two in simulation shows that the noise is neither stationary nor gaussian
  - induced by the motion of lisa as it cartwheels around the sun, coupling to an inhomogeneous sky
  - not stationary over $10^7 seconds$ (1 year)
- stochastic or deterministic?
  - is it a property of the data, or a modelling choice? 
- New paradigm:
  - Joint distribution between stochastic processe over time is almost a gaussian process 
    - (weakly) stationary & ergodic 
- Toy model:
  - [2410.08263](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08263)
  - time series
  - two periodic signals at 1mHz and 5 mHz
  - bunch of stocastic signals
  - Somewhere around 10 mHz the number of sources drops below 1
- Test of gaussianity and stationarity on confusion noise
- washes away the non-gaussianity
- Look out for other publications soon showing this effect from other statistics
- EMRIs: 
  - highly uncertain in terms of rates, numbers, loudness etc
  - [2410.08862](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08862)
- Why does this matter: 
  - Modelling **cyclostationarity** 
    - this accurately describes the noise 
  - Reason #1 Discovering Hidden MW sattellites
  - Reason #2 source misidentification
    - superposition of two gaussian signals with two different amplitudes is not gaussian, could lead to biases in $\Omega_{GW}$, misinterperet multiple $\Omega_{GW,i}$ as a sigle one

Include the figures already uploaded at appropriate points in the text

Please include relevent references with their numbers throughout the text. Format these in markdown as [XXXX.YYYYY](https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.YYYYY), with the correct numbers filled in as inferred from the latex of the paper.

Please use a tone written by a scientific expert, so no hyperbole or spin. The aim is to communicate the science clearly and accurately, but in a way that is accessible to a general audience.
