Create an abstract image that evokes the research of the Handley Research Group, which focuses on cosmology, artificial intelligence, and Bayesian statistics.  The image should suggest the vastness and complexity of the universe, while hinting at the intricate patterns and connections revealed through data analysis and AI.  Consider incorporating elements like:

* **Cosmic webs or filaments:**  Representing the large-scale structure of the universe.
* **Nebulae or galaxies:** Symbolizing the beauty and mystery of the cosmos.
* **Flowing, interconnected lines or networks:**  Illustrating the interconnectedness of data and the flow of information.
* **Abstract geometric shapes:**  Hinting at the mathematical and computational aspects of the research.
* **A sense of depth and dimensionality:**  Conveying the exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces.

The color palette should be sophisticated and evocative, possibly using deep blues, purples, and oranges.  Avoid literal representations of telescopes, computers, or equations.  The overall impression should be one of wonder, exploration, and discovery.  The image should be suitable for use as a header image on a website.  The style should be professional and high-quality, suitable for a scientific research group.
