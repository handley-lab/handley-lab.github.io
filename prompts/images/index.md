Create an abstract image suitable for the header of a website for a cosmology research group. The group uses AI and Bayesian statistics to study topics like the early universe, dark matter, dark energy, and alternative theories of gravity. The image should evoke a sense of complexity, discovery, and the vastness of space, without depicting any specific cosmological phenomena (no stars, galaxies, planets, etc.) or including any text or numbers.  Consider using swirling patterns, nebula-like textures, or representations of interconnected networks to symbolize the interconnectedness of these research areas.  The overall aesthetic should be modern, professional, and intriguing, suitable for a scientific research group.  The color palette can be vibrant or muted, but should be harmonious and visually appealing.  Think "artistic representation of exploring the unknown universe through data".
