**Prompt:**

An abstract digital art piece visualizing the separation of a faint cosmic signal from overwhelming foreground noise.

The scene is a cosmic tapestry. Dominating the image are vast, turbulent waves of luminous orange and red plasma, representing the bright galactic foregrounds. Woven within this chaos, and almost lost, is a delicate, shimmering thread of deep blue and violet light, representing the faint 21cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn.

A subtle spiral or vortex motion is implied, suggesting the passage of time and the rotation of the Earth, which acts as a key to separating the components. The overall effect is one of a complex filtering process on a celestial scale, where a hidden truth is being methodically revealed from a chaotic dataset.

The image should be beautiful and ethereal, with cinematic lighting and a sense of profound discovery. No text or graphs.
