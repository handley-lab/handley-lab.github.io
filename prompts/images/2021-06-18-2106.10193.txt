An abstract, artistic concept image for radio cosmology. A stylized, glowing radio antenna, reminiscent of a conical log spiral, is positioned against a dark cosmic background. The background is filled with turbulent, bright, multi-colored swirls of light, representing overwhelming astrophysical foregrounds. Faintly visible within this chaos is a subtle, regular wave pattern, representing the 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn. The antenna acts as a sophisticated filter: the chaotic light is shown being deflected and scattered away, while the faint, regular waves are collected, focused, and emerge from the antenna as a single, pure, coherent beam of light. The style is ethereal and luminous, digital art with high contrast, emphasizing the separation of a faint signal from immense noise.
