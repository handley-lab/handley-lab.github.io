Excellent. This is a fascinating topic that lends itself well to abstract visualization. The key concepts to capture are:

*   **Nesting/Layers:** The core algorithm's structure.
*   **Order vs. Chaos:** The difference between a correct run (uniform insertion indexes) and a failed run (non-uniform).
*   **Diagnostics/Cross-Checks:** The idea of finding a "flaw" or a "red flag" in a process.
*   **Cosmic/Scientific Aesthetic:** The context where this algorithm is used.

Here is a prompt designed to capture these ideas for an AI image generator, blending the concepts into a single, cohesive image.

### Prompt for AI Image Generation:

**An abstract, sophisticated digital artwork visualizing a statistical self-check for a complex algorithm. The image features a series of translucent, nested, glowing layers, like cosmic shells, receding into a dark, deep space. Flowing across these layers is a stream of luminous particles. On the outer, larger shells, the particles are arranged in a perfectly uniform, evenly-spaced distribution, glowing with a cool, serene blue light. As the stream moves towards the inner, more complex shells, the pattern breaks downâ€”the particles become erratically clumped and scattered, glowing with a disruptive, chaotic orange and red. This visual contrast between order and chaos represents a statistical anomaly being detected. The overall aesthetic is minimalist, scientific, and reminiscent of data flowing through a high-dimensional space in astrophysics.**
