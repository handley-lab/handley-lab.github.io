An abstract, artistic representation of modern cosmology, visualizing the statistical analysis of Type Ia supernovae. The image should feature a central, luminous structure representing a probability distribution. Instead of a soft, diffuse Gaussian bell curve, this shape should be sharp, peaked, and intense, perhaps with crystalline facets, representing a non-Gaussian, leptokurtic likelihood. This focused structure sends brilliant rays of light that illuminate a dark, expansive cosmic background populated by distant, faint galaxies. The intensity of the central light seems to create a subtle, glowing fracture or tension line across the fabric of spacetime, symbolizing the sharpened Hubble Tension. The overall aesthetic should be one of deep space, high contrast, and a sense of revealing a new, sharper reality.
