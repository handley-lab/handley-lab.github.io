Create a visually appealing image suitable for a blog post about accelerating nested sampling with Î²-flows for gravitational wave analysis. The image should evoke the merging of two black holes, the core subject of gravitational wave detection, and subtly hint at the acceleration and flow aspects of the method.  Consider incorporating visual elements representing data flow or acceleration, perhaps through stylized light trails or warped grids.  The overall aesthetic should be scientific and modern. Avoid literal depictions of code or equations. The final image should be in PNG format.
