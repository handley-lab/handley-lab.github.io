Create an abstract image visualizing the concept of dynamical dark energy, potentially changing over time.  The image should evoke a sense of mystery and complexity, hinting at an unknown force influencing the universe's expansion.  Consider using swirling, flowing forms, variations in light and darkness, or other abstract elements to represent the dynamic and elusive nature of dark energy. Avoid literal depictions of graphs, equations, or specific scientific instruments.  The image should be suitable for a blog post header related to a scientific paper on the topic. Think "artistic interpretation" rather than "scientific illustration." The keywords for this image are: dynamic, dark energy, cosmology, abstract, complex, evolving.
