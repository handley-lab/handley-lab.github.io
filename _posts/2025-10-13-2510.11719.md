In a new paper submitted to MNRAS, our group introduces BayeSN-TD, a sophisticated probabilistic model for measuring cosmic distances using gravitationally lensed supernovae ([2510.11719](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11719)). This work, led by M. Grayling, tackles one of the most pressing challenges in modern cosmology: the "Hubble tension," the persistent discrepancy between measurements of the Universe's expansion rate ($H_0$) from the early Universe ([10.1051/0004-6361/201833910](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201833910)) and the local Universe ([10.3847/2041-8213/ac5c5b](https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/ac5c5b)). Gravitationally lensed supernovae, whose multiple images arrive at our telescopes at different times, offer a powerful, independent way to measure $H_0$, an idea first proposed nearly sixty years ago ([10.1093/mnras/128.4.307](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/128.4.307)). Our new tool is designed to maximize the potential of these cosmic laboratories.

### The Challenge of Microlensing

Extracting a precise time delay from a lensed supernova is complicated by microlensing—the gravitational influence of individual stars within the lensing galaxy. As the supernova's expanding photosphere moves behind this field of stars, it experiences time-varying magnification, which can distort the observed light curves and significantly bias the inferred time delays ([10.3847/1538-4357/aaa975](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aaa975)). Naively fitting these light curves with standard supernova models can lead to inaccurate results and underestimated uncertainties. A robust analysis must account for these complex, time-dependent deviations.

### A Flexible Bayesian Solution: BayeSN-TD

BayeSN-TD addresses this challenge head-on. It enhances our group's hierarchical Bayesian model for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), BayeSN, by integrating a flexible, non-parametric treatment of microlensing. Key features of the new model include:
*   **Joint Inference:** BayeSN-TD simultaneously infers the supernova's intrinsic properties (like its light-curve shape), the time delays between images, the magnification of each image, and the unique microlensing signature affecting each light path.
*   **Gaussian Process Modeling:** We model the time-varying microlensing effect as a Gaussian Process (GP). This allows the model to learn the shape of the magnification curve from the data without imposing a rigid physical model. Specifically, we use a non-stationary Gibbs kernel, which is adept at capturing the rapid changes expected as the supernova crosses a stellar caustic.
*   **Marginalization of Nuisances:** By treating microlensing within a probabilistic framework, we can robustly marginalize over its effects, ensuring that the uncertainties on the time delay and $H_0$ properly account for this physical nuisance.

We rigorously tested BayeSN-TD on large suites of simulated lensed supernovae, including realistic mock observations for the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST ([10.1093/mnras/stae1356](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stae1356)). Our method proved remarkably robust, delivering well-calibrated time-delay uncertainties even when the simulations were generated with a different supernova model (SALT) and included chromatic microlensing—a wavelength-dependent effect that our current achromatic model averages over.

### Application to SN H0pe and the Hubble Constant

We applied BayeSN-TD to the publicly available photometric data for SN H0pe, the first lensed SN Ia with time delays long enough for a competitive $H_0$ measurement ([10.3847/1538-4357/ad3c43](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3c43)). Our analysis yielded time delays of $\Delta T_{BA}=121.9^{+9.5}_{-7.5}$ days and $\Delta T_{BC}=63.2^{+3.2}_{-3.3}$ days. By combining these measurements with existing lens models of the galaxy cluster system ([10.3847/1538-4357/ad9928](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ad9928)), we derive a constraint on the Hubble constant of $H_0=69.3^{+12.6}_{-7.8}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.

While this measurement is not yet precise enough to definitively arbitrate the Hubble tension, it demonstrates the power of our methodology. The development of BayeSN-TD provides a vital tool for the coming era of time-domain astronomy. With the anticipated discovery of dozens of lensed supernovae by LSST, robust and principled analysis tools like this will be essential for realizing the full potential of time-delay cosmography and unlocking new insights into the fundamental properties of our Universe.
