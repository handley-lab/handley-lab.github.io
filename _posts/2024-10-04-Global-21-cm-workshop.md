## Exploring the Cosmic Dawn: A Report from the 7th Global 21-cm Workshop

Our group recently returned from the **7th Global 21-cm Workshop**, held at the Raman Research Institute in Bangalore, India. The workshop brought together experts from around the world to discuss the ongoing quest to detect the faint signal from neutral hydrogen in the early Universe, a signal that holds the key to understanding the formation of the first stars and galaxies. 

Representing our group at the workshop were:

* [Will Handley](/people/will-handley) - [Talk](https://github.com/williamjameshandley/talks/tree/india_2024)
* [Sam Leeney](/people/sam-leeney) - [Talk link coming soon]
* [Harry Bevins](/people/harry-bevins) - [Talk link coming soon]
* [George Carter](/people/george-carter) - [Talk link coming soon]

**Our Research Focus:**

We specialize in developing and applying advanced data analysis techniques, particularly artificial intelligence and Bayesian inference, to extract subtle signals from complex datasets. This expertise is particularly relevant to the search for the 21-cm signal, which is incredibly faint and often obscured by noise and foreground emissions.

**Why This Workshop Matters:**

The workshop provided a valuable forum for sharing the latest developments in 21-cm cosmology and exploring new ideas for pushing the field forward.  We were particularly interested in discussions about:

* **New observational strategies:** Several groups presented on innovative telescope designs and observation techniques aimed at improving the sensitivity and accuracy of 21-cm measurements.
* **Advanced data analysis methods:**  A significant focus of the workshop was on developing and refining data analysis techniques, including machine learning algorithms, to effectively extract the 21-cm signal from noisy data. 
* **Theoretical modeling and interpretation:**  Alongside observational efforts, theoretical models play a crucial role in predicting the characteristics of the 21-cm signal and interpreting the data.

**Our Contributions:**

Will gave a talk on our latest work on applying AI to 21-cm data analysis, highlighting the potential of these techniques to enhance signal detection and extract more precise information about the early Universe. Sam, Harry, and George also presented their research at the workshop.  Links to their talks will be added here soon.

**Looking Ahead:**

The workshop reinforced our belief that the field of 21-cm cosmology is on the verge of a major breakthrough.  With ongoing advancements in observational technology and data analysis, we are getting closer than ever to directly observing the Cosmic Dawn and unraveling the mysteries of the first stars and galaxies.
