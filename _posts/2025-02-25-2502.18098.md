The Cosmic Dawn, the era when the first stars ignited and ended the universal dark ages, remains one of the most enigmatic frontiers in cosmology. A central uncertainty from this epoch is the nature of these first, metal-free Population III (Pop III) stars, particularly their initial mass function (IMF)—the distribution of their masses at birth. In a new paper, [**2502.18098**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18098), a team led by [Thomas Gessey-Jones](https://www.cavendishradiocosmology.com/) demonstrates that the cosmological 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen is a uniquely powerful tool to resolve this mystery. The study shows that upcoming radio telescopes have the sensitivity to definitively measure the Pop III IMF, bridging a critical gap in our understanding of the early Universe.

### A New Window on the First Stars

The 21-cm signal is a faint radio signature whose strength depends on the thermal state of the intergalactic medium (IGM). The first stars played a crucial role by heating the IGM, but the exact nature of this heating depends strongly on their properties. While previous work, such as the group's earlier study ([2202.02099](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02099)), explored the link between the Pop III IMF and the 21-cm signal via Lyman-alpha radiation, this new research reveals a far more sensitive probe: X-rays from high-mass X-ray binaries (XRBs).

The key findings of the paper are:
*   **Enhanced Sensitivity through X-ray Binaries:** The study incorporates, for the first time, a self-consistent model showing that the abundance and luminosity of Pop III XRBs are profoundly dependent on the stellar IMF. This is based on detailed population synthesis simulations ([2303.03435](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03435)). A top-heavy IMF, for example, produces more massive black holes in binary systems, leading to drastically different X-ray heating of the IGM compared to a bottom-heavy IMF. This effect creates a much stronger, more discernible signature in the 21-cm signal than previously thought.
*   **Distinct Signatures for Different IMFs:** The team simulated the 21-cm global signal and power spectrum for a range of plausible IMF models, from bottom-heavy (Salpeter-like) to extremely top-heavy distributions. The resulting variations in the timing and depth of the 21-cm absorption trough, as well as the structure of the power spectrum, are significant and distinguishable.

### Forecasting Constraints with Next-Generation Observatories

To assess the real-world potential of these findings, the authors—including [Harry Bevins](https://htjb.github.io/), [Anastasia Fialkov](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/people/Anastasia.Fialkov), [Will Handley](https://willhandley.co.uk), and [Eloy de Lera Acedo](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-eloy-de-lera-acedo)—employed the group's signature Bayesian analysis framework, powered by neural network emulators. This advanced statistical approach allowed for robust forecasting of the capabilities of key 21-cm experiments.

The analysis predicts that:
*   An experiment measuring the sky-averaged global signal, like **REACH**, could provide **three-sigma constraints** on the Pop III IMF with an instrumental sensitivity of just 25 mK.
*   An interferometer targeting the 21-cm power spectrum, like **SKA-Low**, could achieve the same **three-sigma constraints** with 3,000 hours of foreground-avoidance observations.

These forecasts demonstrate that a definitive measurement of the mass distribution of the first stars is within reach in the near future, promising to transform our understanding of cosmic dawn, a field extensively reviewed in works like Furlanetto et al. ([astro-ph/0608032](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0608032)).

### Implications for Cosmology and Astrophysics

Measuring the Pop III IMF will have profound implications beyond just characterizing the first stars. Such a measurement will provide crucial context for interpreting observations from JWST, which has hinted at the presence of top-heavy Pop III populations to explain extremely luminous high-redshift galaxies ([2208.01612](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01612)).

Furthermore, this work sounds a critical cautionary note. The authors show that assuming an incorrect Pop III IMF when analyzing future precision 21-cm data could lead to significant biases in the inferred values of other astrophysical parameters. Accurately modeling the first stars is therefore not just an isolated challenge but a prerequisite for robustly testing the standard cosmological model. By establishing a clear path to measure this fundamental property, this research paves the way for a new era of precision 21-cm cosmology.
