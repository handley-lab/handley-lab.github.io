Nested sampling is a powerful Bayesian inference technique that is particularly useful in astrophysics for model comparison and parameter estimation.  Its ability to compute the Bayesian evidence makes it invaluable for tasks such as distinguishing between competing theories of the universe. However, this power comes at a computational cost, which can be significant when analyzing complex datasets like those from gravitational wave detectors, especially when using detailed waveform models. Our new paper, "Accelerated nested sampling with $β$-flows for gravitational waves" ([arXiv:2411.17663](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17663)), introduces a novel method to address this challenge.

Lead author [Metha Prathaban](https://www.hardingscholars.fund.cam.ac.uk/metha-prathaban-2022-cohort), a Harding Scholar and member of our Cambridge research group, spearheaded the development of $β$-flows, a new type of conditional normalizing flow.  Normalizing flows are powerful generative models that have shown promise in various scientific applications, including accelerating statistical inference.  However, standard normalizing flows often struggle to accurately represent the tails of probability distributions, which are crucial for accurate Bayesian inference. $β$-flows, trained on the entire nested sampling run and conditioned on an inverse temperature parameter β, are designed to overcome this limitation by better capturing these deep tail probabilities.

This research builds on previous work on posterior repartitioning, a technique that leverages nested sampling's ability to separate prior and likelihood contributions. By constructing a "repartitioned prior" informed by a low-resolution nested sampling run, we can significantly reduce the computational burden of subsequent high-resolution runs. Our paper demonstrates how $β$-flows provide a robust and efficient way to implement posterior repartitioning, leading to a substantial acceleration of nested sampling.  When applied to both simulated and real binary black hole merger data using the IMRPhenomXPHM waveform model, our method reduced the number of likelihood evaluations needed for convergence by up to an order of magnitude. This acceleration is crucial for enabling faster model comparison and parameter estimation in gravitational wave analyses, ultimately advancing our understanding of these cataclysmic events.

[Harry Bevins](https://htjb.github.io/), whose previous work focused on machine learning enhanced tools for Bayesian analysis ([arXiv:2207.11457](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11457), [DOI:10.1093/mnras/stad2997](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stad2997)), and [Will Handley](https://willhandley.co.uk) co-authored the study. This work is contextualized within a rich body of literature on nested sampling acceleration, including methods like dynamic nested sampling ([DOI:10.1007/s11222-018-9844-0](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11222-018-9844-0)) and SuperNest ([arXiv:2212.01760](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01760)). The use of normalizing flows for defining non-trivial priors ([DOI:10.1093/mnrasl/slab057](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnrasl/slab057)) and accelerating inference is also a key element of our approach.  Furthermore, our research complements ongoing efforts to improve waveform models for gravitational wave analysis, such as those focusing on reduced-order quadratures ([DOI:10.1103/PhysRevD.108.123025](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.123025)) and multiband interpolation ([DOI:10.1088/1361-6382/aa6d44](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6382/aa6d44)).
