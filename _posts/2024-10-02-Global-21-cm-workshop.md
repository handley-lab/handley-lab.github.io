## Searching for the Cosmic Dawn: Reflections on the 7th Global 21-cm Workshop and the Elusive First Stars

From October 2nd, 2024, our group joined the global community of researchers at the Raman Research Institute in Bangalore, India for the **7th Global 21-cm Workshop**. This gathering, focused on detecting the faint signal from neutral hydrogen in the early Universe, felt particularly significant this year. The race is on to definitively uncover the secrets held within this signal â€“ secrets that promise to illuminate the formation of the first stars and galaxies.

**The Thrill of a Possible Detection, and the Ensuing Debate:**

In 2018, the EDGES experiment in Australia sent ripples of excitement through the cosmology community with a potential detection of the 21-cm signal.  This finding, if confirmed, would have marked a groundbreaking discovery, offering a glimpse into the Universe just 180 million years after the Big Bang.  However, the EDGES signal was both unexpectedly deep and found at an unexpected frequency, raising questions within the scientific community. 

Adding fuel to the fire, a group at Cambridge University raised concerns about the EDGES analysis, suggesting that the signal might be an artifact of the instrument or data processing.  Further complicating the picture, the SARAS experiment in India conducted independent observations and claimed to have refuted the EDGES detection.

**The Quest Continues:**

This exciting debate underscores the challenges and importance of definitively detecting and characterizing the 21-cm signal.  The global effort to refine observational techniques, improve data analysis, and develop sophisticated theoretical models is crucial to resolving this puzzle.

**Looking ahead:**

The 7th Global 21-cm Workshop highlighted the incredible progress being made in this field.  With ongoing and future experiments like REACH ([https://www.astro.phy.cam.ac.uk/research/research-projects/reach](https://www.astro.phy.cam.ac.uk/research/research-projects/reach)), we are entering a new era of precision cosmology. By pushing the boundaries of observation and analysis, we are closing in on the elusive signal from the first stars and galaxies, ready to unveil a pivotal chapter in the story of our Universe.
